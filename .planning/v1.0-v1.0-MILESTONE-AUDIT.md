# Milestone v1.0 Audit Report

## Executive Result

Milestone v1.0 now satisfies definition-of-done. The audit result is **passed** because HOST-11 implementation, integration flow, and governance verification artifacts are all closed and traceable.

## Scorecard

| Area | Score | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Requirements coverage | 44/44 | ✓ Passed |
| Phase verification artifacts | 11/11 | ✓ Passed |
| Cross-phase integration | 12/12 | ✓ Passed |
| E2E user flows | 6/6 | ✓ Passed |

## Milestone Scope

| Phase | Directory | Verification Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `01-foundation` | passed |
| 2 | `02-menu-bar-state` | passed |
| 3 | `03-host-monitoring` | passed |
| 4 | `04-display-modes` | passed |
| 5 | `05-visualization` | passed |
| 6 | `06-notifications-settings` | passed |
| 7 | `07-settings` | passed |
| 8 | `08-visualization-reconciliation-verification` | passed |
| 9 | `09-regression-test-wiring-recovery` | passed |
| 10 | `10-true-icmp-support` | passed |
| 11 | `11-11` | passed |

## Closure Evidence

1. **Phase 10 formal verification artifact is now present and passed**
   - `.planning/phases/10-true-icmp-support/10-true-icmp-support-VERIFICATION.md`
   - Includes `status: passed` and explicit HOST-11 evidence links.

2. **ICMP host persistence and scheduler flow regressions are passing and linked**
   - `Tests/PingScopeTests/ICMPHostFlowIntegrationTests.swift`
   - `Tests/PingScopeTests/PingSchedulerTests.swift`
   - Evidence summarized in `.planning/phases/12-icmp-host-persistence-verification-closure/12-02-SUMMARY.md`.

3. **Requirements traceability is closed for HOST-11**
   - `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` now marks HOST-11 as complete.

## Requirements Coverage (v1)

Source of truth: `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` traceability table.

- Total mapped v1 requirements: **44**
- Satisfied: **44**
- Unsatisfied: **0**

### HOST-11 Closure

- **HOST-11:** True ICMP ping when running outside sandbox; ICMP option hidden when sandboxed
  - Status: **Complete**
  - Closure basis: Phase 10 implementation + non-sandbox behavior verification + Phase 12 persistence-to-scheduler regression coverage + formal verification artifact.

## Cross-Phase Integration Findings

Integration closure result:
- `integration_score: 12/12`
- `flows_score: 6/6`
- Recommendation: **PASS milestone DoD**

### End-to-End Flow Status

| Flow | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ping loop -> result ingestion -> menu bar state update | ✓ Complete | Verified in prior milestone checks. |
| Ping loop -> host matching -> visualization ingest -> graph/history/stats render | ✓ Complete | Verified in prior milestone checks. |
| Settings host CRUD -> HostStore persist -> scheduler update -> live UI refresh | ✓ Complete | Verified in prior milestone checks. |
| Context menu/gear/Cmd+, -> single settings window focus behavior | ✓ Complete | Verified in prior milestone checks. |
| Notification pipeline -> preference gating -> NotificationService dispatch | ✓ Complete | Verified in prior milestone checks. |
| ICMP host CRUD -> persist -> scheduler monitoring | ✓ Complete | Closed by HOST-11 persistence and scheduler integration regressions plus Phase 10 verification artifact. |

## Remaining Non-Blocking Debt

- Minor historical planning wording normalization remains optional maintenance and does not block v1.0 readiness.

## Recommendation

Milestone v1.0 is ready to be considered complete from a requirements, integration, and governance perspective.
