<objective>
Human verification of visualization polish and 1-hour history capacity.

Purpose: These changes are user-facing and visual. A short verification pass prevents shipping a graph that technically works but misses the intended macOS-native aesthetic.

Output: Confirmed behavior (or a clear list of adjustments needed).

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <what-built>Graph styling polish (gradient fill + point markers) and 3600-sample per-host history buffer default</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
1) Run tests: `swift test` (should pass).
2) Run the app from Xcode.
3) Open the full view and select a host with active pings.
4) Set time range to "Last 1 hour" and confirm:
   - The graph shows a line with a visible gradient fill under it.
   - Point markers are visible and do not make the chart unreadable.
   - The look/feel is similar to macOS Activity Monitor (subtle grid, native colors).
5) Let the app run briefly and scroll the Recent Results list; confirm it continues to populate and remains responsive.
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>Type "approved" or describe what feels off (fill color, grid contrast, marker density, etc.)</resume-signal>
