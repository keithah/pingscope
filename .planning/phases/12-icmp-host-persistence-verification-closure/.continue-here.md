<current_state>
Roadmap execution is complete (12/12 phases done), and milestone audit was re-run this session. The new audit result is tech_debt (not blockers): functional completion is confirmed, but docs consistency cleanup remains optional.

Most recent working area detected by mtime: `12-icmp-host-persistence-verification-closure`.
</current_state>

<completed_work>

- Task 1: Milestone verification aggregation - Done
  - Read PROJECT/REQUIREMENTS/ROADMAP/config and all phase VERIFICATION artifacts (01-12).
  - Collected statuses, requirement coverage signals, and debt notes.
- Task 2: Cross-phase integration check - Done
  - Spawned `gsd-integration-checker`; result: status `passed`, integration `12/12`, flows `6/6`, no critical gaps.
- Task 3: Milestone audit refresh - Done
  - Updated `.planning/v1.0-v1.0-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md` to current run.
  - Final status now `tech_debt` with no requirement/integration/flow blockers.

</completed_work>

<remaining_work>

- Task 1: Decide milestone close path - Pending
  - Option A: complete milestone now (`/gsd-complete-milestone v1.0`).
  - Option B: plan a small cleanup phase for docs debt (`/gsd-plan-milestone-gaps`).
- Task 2: If cleanup chosen, execute docs-only closure - Not started
  - Sync top checklist vs traceability status in `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md`.
  - Normalize lingering `Sources/PingMonitor/...` references in older verification docs to `Sources/PingScope/...`.

</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

- Chose to mark audit as `tech_debt` rather than `passed` because non-blocking debt was explicitly present (requirements checklist sync + legacy path references).
- Treated integration checker as source of truth for cross-phase wiring and E2E flow health; no additional manual gap inflation added.
- Kept milestone scope at v1.0 current state (all 12 phases), not historical 11-phase snapshot.

</decisions_made>

<blockers>
- No technical blockers.
- Pending product decision only: accept debt and complete milestone now vs run docs cleanup first.
</blockers>

<context>
State is stable and low risk. Functional delivery is complete; this is governance polish territory. The practical vibe is "ship is ready, docs can be polished if desired." Keep any follow-up narrowly scoped to planning docs; do not reopen runtime implementation work.

Working tree context to preserve:
- Modified by this session: `.planning/v1.0-v1.0-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md`.
- Pre-existing untracked planning files also present (multiple `*-PLAN.md` and `*-RESEARCH.md` files under phases 06/08/09/11/12); treat as user-owned unless asked to clean up.
</context>

<next_action>
Start with: choose closure path.

If ready to finish now: run `/gsd-complete-milestone v1.0`.
If you want docs debt closed first: run `/gsd-plan-milestone-gaps` and limit scope to documentation consistency only.
</next_action>
