<objective>
Human verification checkpoint for Settings end-to-end.

Purpose: Settings are user-facing and must be verified in the real app (menu-bar, accessory activation, window behavior).
Output: Approval to mark Settings-focused phase complete, or a concrete list of gaps.

  <what-built>Settings reliability + live updates + persistence</what-built>
<how-to-verify>
1) Launch the app from a bundled .app build (not `swift run`): use the project’s dev run script if present.

2) Verify Settings opens from all entry points:
   - Cmd+,
   - Menu bar right-click -> Settings...
   - In-app gear -> Settings...
   Expected: same Settings window focuses; no duplicates.

3) Visual match:
   - Compare Settings window to `images/settings_final.png`
   - Expected: single pane with Application/Display/Notifications sections + Monitored Hosts list + Reset/Cancel/Done footer

4) Hosts section:
   - Add a host
   - Confirm it appears immediately in the monitoring UI and begins scheduling pings
   - Edit the host; confirm changes apply live
   - Delete the host; confirm it is removed live

5) Display toggles:
   - Toggle Compact Mode and Stay on Top
   - Confirm behavior changes immediately
   - Toggle Monitored Hosts / Show Graph / Show History / History Summary
   - Confirm full mode updates immediately

6) Persistence:
   - Quit the app
   - Relaunch
   - Confirm hosts + display toggles + notification toggles persisted
