## v1.2+ Requirements

Deferred to future releases.

### Post-Approval Optimization

- **META-15**: App preview video created (20-30 seconds)
- **META-16**: TestFlight external testing with public beta users
- **META-17**: Keyword optimization using ASO tools (AppTweak, Asolytics)
- **META-18**: Localization for top 5-10 languages
- **META-19**: Custom product pages for A/B testing
- **META-20**: Multiple screenshot sizes (all 4 resolutions)

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Widget extension | Defer to v2.0 — focus on distribution first |
| Data export features | Defer to v2.0 — focus on distribution first |
| App preview video | Defer to v1.2 — manual submission first, optimize after approval |
| External TestFlight | Defer to v1.2 — internal testing sufficient for first submission |
| ASO tool optimization | Defer to v1.2 — manual keyword research for initial launch |
| Multi-language support | Defer to v2.0+ — English-only for initial release |
| Custom product pages | Defer to v2.0+ — requires App Store presence first |
