# Milestone v1.0 Audit Report

## Executive Result

Milestone v1.0 has no critical blockers: all mapped requirements are satisfied, every phase has a passing verification artifact, cross-phase integration is wired, and end-to-end flows are complete. Final status is **tech_debt** due to accumulated non-blocking documentation consistency debt.

## Scorecard

| Area | Score | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Requirements coverage | 44/44 | Passed |
| Phase verification artifacts | 12/12 | Passed |
| Cross-phase integration links | 12/12 | Passed |
| E2E user flows | 6/6 | Passed |

## Requirements Coverage

| Requirement Group | Covered | Total | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Menu Bar (`MENU-*`) | 7 | 7 | Complete |
| Host Monitoring (`HOST-*`) | 11 | 11 | Complete |
| Visualization (`VIS-*`) | 7 | 7 | Complete |
| Display Modes (`DISP-*`) | 6 | 6 | Complete |
| Notifications (`NOTF-*`) | 10 | 10 | Complete |
| Settings (`SETT-*`) | 6 | 6 | Complete |
| Core Technical (`TECH-*`) | 7 | 7 | Complete |
| **Total** | **44** | **44** | **Complete** |

## Phase Verification Status

| Phase | Directory | Verification | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `01-foundation` | passed | Foundation async/lifecycle behavior validated |
| 2 | `02-menu-bar-state` | passed | Menu interactions and runtime wiring validated |
| 3 | `03-host-monitoring` | passed | Re-verified after gap closure |
| 4 | `04-display-modes` | passed | Human verification completed |
| 5 | `05-visualization` | passed | Runtime resize gap fixed, then approved |
| 6 | `06-notifications-settings` | passed | Re-verified after settings gap closure |
| 7 | `07-settings` | passed | End-to-end settings behavior approved |
| 8 | `08-visualization-reconciliation-verification` | passed | VIS reconciliation and traceability closure |
| 9 | `09-regression-test-wiring-recovery` | passed | Regression compile/run baseline restored |
| 10 | `10-true-icmp-support` | passed | HOST-11 runtime + integration evidence closed |
| 11 | `11-11` | passed | Debt-closure acceptance evidence captured |
| 12 | `12-icmp-host-persistence-verification-closure` | passed | ICMP persistence flow and governance closure |

## Cross-Phase Integration

| Link | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PingService -> ConnectionSweeper/ConnectionWrapper lifecycle | Pass | `Sources/PingScope/Services/PingService.swift`, `Sources/PingScope/Services/ConnectionWrapper.swift` |
| Scheduler -> menu bar/display/notifications ingest chain | Pass | `Sources/PingScope/App/AppDelegate.swift` |
| Host CRUD -> HostStore -> scheduler update | Pass | `Sources/PingScope/App/AppDelegate.swift`, `Sources/PingScope/Services/HostStore.swift` |
| Host selection -> threshold-aware status classification | Pass | `Sources/PingScope/MenuBar/MenuBarRuntime.swift`, `Sources/PingScope/ViewModels/MenuBarViewModel.swift` |
| DisplayModeCoordinator shell orchestration | Pass | `Sources/PingScope/App/AppDelegate.swift`, `Sources/PingScope/MenuBar/DisplayModeCoordinator.swift` |
| ICMP capability/filtering/routing/persistence-to-scheduler | Pass | `Sources/PingScope/Models/PingMethod.swift`, `Sources/PingScope/Services/PingService.swift`, `Tests/PingScopeTests/ICMPHostFlowIntegrationTests.swift` |

Integration checker outcome: **12/12 links validated, 0 blockers**.

## End-to-End Flows

| Flow | Result | Breakpoint |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ping loop -> menu bar status update | Pass | None |
| Ping loop -> visualization graph/history/stats | Pass | None |
| Settings host CRUD -> persistence -> live monitoring update | Pass | None |
| Settings entry points -> single window focus behavior | Pass | None |
| Notification evaluation -> preference gating -> dispatch | Pass | None |
| ICMP host CRUD -> persist -> scheduler monitoring | Pass | None |

## Critical Gaps

No critical requirement, integration, or flow gaps found.

## Non-Critical Tech Debt

| Area | Item | Severity |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Requirements docs | Top-level `- [ ]` checklist rows are not synchronized with traceability completion rows in `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` | Non-blocking |
| Verification docs | Some legacy path references still mention `Sources/PingMonitor/...` in older verification artifacts | Non-blocking |

## Recommendation

Milestone v1.0 is ready to complete functionally. If desired, run a short docs-cleanup pass to align checklist/path consistency before final archival.
