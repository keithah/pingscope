Professional network latency monitoring from your Mac menu bar. Track multiple hosts simultaneously with real-time graphs, automatic gateway detection, and comprehensive ping statistics. Choose between full and compact display modes.

MULTI-HOST MONITORING
• Monitor multiple hosts at once with independent intervals
• Automatic gateway detection via network topology analysis
• Default hosts included (Google DNS, Cloudflare DNS)
• Custom host support with TCP, UDP, or ICMP methods

REAL-TIME VISUALIZATION
• Live latency graph with 1hr/10m/5m/1m time ranges
• Activity Monitor-style gradient visualization
• Detailed ping history with timestamps and statistics
• Color-coded status indicators (green/yellow/red)

FLEXIBLE DISPLAY MODES
• Full mode: comprehensive interface with graphs and history
• Compact mode: streamlined view for less screen space
• Stay-on-top floating window option
• Menu bar status with live latency updates

SMART NOTIFICATIONS
• Seven alert types (host down, restored, high latency, packet loss, gateway change, internet loss, intermittent)
• Per-host notification overrides
• Cooldown behavior to prevent alert fatigue
• Configurable thresholds for latency and packet loss

DUAL PING METHODS
• TCP ping: universal compatibility, works through most firewalls
• UDP ping: low overhead for DNS servers
• True ICMP ping: available in non-sandboxed Developer ID distribution

Requires macOS 13.0 or later. Designed for network administrators, developers, remote workers, and anyone monitoring network reliability.
