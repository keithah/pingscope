DUAL DISTRIBUTION MODEL

PingScope is distributed in two configurations:

1. APP STORE (SANDBOXED)
   - Sandbox enabled per App Store requirements
   - ICMP ping method hidden from UI (requires raw sockets not available in sandbox)
   - TCP and UDP ping methods fully functional
   - All other features identical to non-sandboxed build

2. DEVELOPER ID (NON-SANDBOXED)
   - Direct download from developer website
   - ICMP ping method available (uses non-privileged datagram ICMP sockets)
   - TCP and UDP ping methods also available
   - No sandbox restrictions

TESTING INSTRUCTIONS

For this App Store submission:
1. Method dropdown shows only TCP and UDP (ICMP correctly hidden)
2. TCP ping works (try port 80 to google.com)
3. UDP ping works (try port 53 to 8.8.8.8)
4. Menu bar updates with live latency values
5. All non-ICMP features function identically to v1.0

The app uses SandboxDetector utility to determine runtime environment and filters UI accordingly. This is NOT feature limitation - it's appropriate sandbox behavior. Users who need ICMP will use our Developer ID distribution.
